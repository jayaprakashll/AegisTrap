# AegisTrap | AI-Driven Malware Detection & Cyber Threat Analysis

## 📌 Overview

AegisTrap is an advanced AI-powered malware detection system that utilizes **machine learning** and **reverse engineering** to classify files as malicious or benign with high accuracy. By analyzing executables, scripts, and macro-based malware, the system uncovers behavioral anomalies and suspicious patterns. **VirusTotal API** and **YARA rules** enhance the identification and analysis of emerging threats.

## 🚀 Features

- **Machine Learning-Powered Malware Detection**: Uses **TensorFlow** and **Scikit-Learn** for precise classification.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Examines **Windows executables, PowerShell scripts, and macro-based malware** for anomalies.
- **Real-Time Threat Intelligence**: Integrates with **VirusTotal API** for instant malware reputation analysis.
- **YARA-Based Threat Hunting**: Leverages YARA rules to detect malware signatures and patterns.
- **Automated Log Tracking & Alerting**: Enhances risk assessment and incident response efficiency.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. **Feature Extraction**: Identifies static and dynamic features from executables and scripts.
2. **ML-Based Classification**: Predicts malicious or benign files using trained AI models.
3. **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Enriches analysis with VirusTotal and YARA rule detection.
4. **Incident Response & Reporting**: Logs detected threats and generates alerts.

## 📜 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, YARA-Python**
- **VirusTotal API Key**

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AegisTrap.git
   cd AegisTrap
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Malware Analysis**
   ```bash
   python Scanner.py --file sample.exe
   ```
4. **Check Reports & Threat Intelligence**
   - YARA rule matches will be logged in `logs/`
   - VirusTotal results will be stored in `reports/`

## 📊 Threat Analysis & Reporting

- **Static & Dynamic Analysis**: Extracts metadata, API calls, and execution behavior.
- **Signature-Based Detection**: Matches known malware patterns using YARA.
- **ML-Based Detection**: Predicts malicious intent based on extracted features.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends notifications upon threat detection.

## 🔒 Security & Maintenance

- Regularly update the **ML model** with new threat samples.
- Enhance **YARA rules** for better detection coverage.
- Ensure **VirusTotal API usage** within the allowed rate limits.

## 🔥 Future Enhancements

- **Deep Learning Integration** for improved threat classification.
- **Cloud-Based Threat Intelligence** with SIEM compatibility.
- **Sandboxed Execution** for in-depth malware behavior analysis.
